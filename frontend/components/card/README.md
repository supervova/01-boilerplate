# üóÇÔ∏è Card

A **Card** is a flexible and reusable UI container used to group related information. It commonly includes content such as a **title**, **image**, **summary**, **action buttons**, and optionally **metadata**. Cards are ideal for presenting information in a modular, scannable, and responsive format.

Cards help:

- visually separate different types of content,
- enhance readability and hierarchy,
- provide quick actions or entry points.

They are often used in **grids, feeds, dashboards, and previews**.
