# Header Components Overview

`header.header` and `header.topnav` are different components that occupy approximately the same area on the page.

1. `header.topnav` is the global navigation of the site or application â€” a list of links to main sections, as well as a sliding search panel. On mobile devices, `.topnav` is split into two panels: a bottom navigation bar and a top bar containing the logo, search button, and user menu button.
2. `header.header` is an additional navigation panel for sites or applications where the main navigation is placed in a sidebar on tablets and desktops. `header.header` contains an expanded search form, a user menu, and may include extra elements such as a cart button, key service statistics, etc.
