# vendors/

This folder contains **third-party code or external plugins** that are **not maintained** by the project.

Use it for:

- Adapted UI components from external sources
- Vendor-specific CSS or JS (e.g. [Swiper carousel](https://swiperjs.com/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/))
- Imported code that cannot be (or should not be) installed via npm
- Static or legacy code dropped into the project

ðŸš« Avoid editing vendor files unless absolutely necessary.
