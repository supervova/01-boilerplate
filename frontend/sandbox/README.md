# Sandbox - A playground for CSS experiments

This folder is meant for testing new CSS features and creative techniques â€” both original and community-inspired.

By default, everything here (except this README) is ignored by Git. To include these files in version control, delete the `sandbox/*` entry from `.gitignore`.
