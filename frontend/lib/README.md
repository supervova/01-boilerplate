# lib/

This folder contains **project-specific utilities and logic**.

Use it for:

- API helpers (e.g. `fetch-api.ts`)
- Utility functions (e.g. `formatDate`, `slugify`)
- Constants and enums
- Type definitions (`types.ts`)
- Client-side logic related to business rules

âœ… All code here is written or maintained in-house.
